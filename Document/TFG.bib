	abstract = {We conjecture the following entropy bound to be valid in all space-times admitted by Einstein's equation: Let A be the area of any two-dimensional surface. Let L be a hypersurface generated by surface-orthogonal null geodesics with non-positive expansion. Let S be the entropy on L. Then S does not exceed A/4. We present evidence that the bound can be saturated, but not exceeded, in cosmological solutions and in the interior of black holes. For systems with limited self-gravity it reduces to Bekenstein's bound. Because the conjecture is manifestly time reversal invariant, its origin cannot be thermodynamic, but must be statistical. Thus it places a fundamental limit on the number of degrees of freedom in nature.},

Rather, the observable degrees of freedom can best be described as if they were Boolean variables defined on a two-dimensional lattice, evolving with time. This observation, deduced from not much more than unitarity, entropy and counting arguments, implies severe restrictions on possible models of quantum gravity. Using cellular automata as an example it is argued that this dimensional reduction implies more constraints than the freedom we have in constructing models. This is the main reason why so-far no completely consistent mathematical models of quantum black holes have been found. Essay dedicated to Abdus Salam.},

This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{{\textbackslash}cal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are {IIB} strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-{deSitter} spacetimes are dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.},

	abstract = {The entanglement entropy of three-dimensional conformal field theories contains a universal contribution coming from corners in the entangling surface. We study these contributions in a holographic framework and, in particular, we consider the effects of higher curvature interactions in the bulk gravity theory. We find that for all of our holographic models, the corner contribution is only modified by an overall factor but the functional dependence on the opening angle is not modified by the new gravitational interactions. We also compare the dependence of the corner term on the new gravitational couplings to that for a number of other physical quantities, and we show that the ratio of the corner contribution over the central charge appearing in the two-point function of the stress tensor is a universal function for all of the holographic theories studied here. Comparing this holographic result to the analogous functions for free {CFT}'s, we find fairly good agreement across the full range of the opening angle. However, there is a precise match in the limit where the entangling surface becomes smooth, i.e., the angle approaches \${\textbackslash}pi\$, and we conjecture the corresponding ratio is a universal constant for all three-dimensional conformal field theories. In this paper, we expand on the holographic calculations in our previous letter {arXiv}:1505.04804, where this conjecture was first introduced.},

              one match

              equal.
              In general there is but one match, but there can be more. If, in addition to the first match, there is a second one between canonical conjugates of the first mates, then there are infinitely many matches, every function of the first canonical pair matching with the same function of the second canonical pair. Thus there is a complete one-to-one correspondence between
              those
              two branches (of the two families of observables) which relate to the two degrees of freedom in question. If there
              are
              no others, the one-to-one correspondence persists as time advances, but the observables of the first system (say) change their mates in the way that the latter, i.e. the observables of the second system, undergo a certain continuous contact-transformation.},

While this framework has been exploited for regions with a high degree of symmetry, we take the first steps towards understanding general entangling regions, focusing on {AdS}\$\_4\$. Inspired by simple constructions achieved for the case of disks and the half-plane, we reformulate bit threads in terms of a magnetic-like field generated by a current flowing through the boundary of the entangling region. The construction is possible for these highly symmetric settings, leading us to a modified Biot-Savart law in curved space that fully characterizes the entanglement structure of the state. For general entangling regions, the prescription breaks down as the corresponding modular Hamiltonians become inherently nonlocal. We develop a formalism for general shape deformations and derive a flow equation that accounts for these effects as a systematic expansion. We solve this equation for a complete set of small deformations and show that the structure of the expansion explicitly codifies the expected nonlocalities. Our findings are consistent with numerical results existing in the literature, and shed light on the fundamental nature of quantum entanglement as a nonlocal phenomenon.},

For a disk region, \$F{\textbar}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm disk\}{\textbackslash}equiv F\_0\$ coincides with the free energy on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{S\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ and provides an {RG}-monotone for general theories. As opposed to the analogous quantity in four dimensions, the value of \$F\$ generally depends in a complicated (and non-local) way on the geometry of the region and the theory under consideration. For small geometric deformations of the disk in general {CFTs} as well as for arbitrary regions in holographic theories, it has been argued that \$F\$ is precisely minimized by disks. Here, we argue that \$F\$ is globally minimized by disks with respect to arbitrary regions and for general theories. The proof makes use of the strong subadditivity of entanglement entropy and the geometric fact that one can always place an osculating circle within a given smooth entangling region. For topologically non-trivial entangling regions with \$n\_B\$ boundaries, the general bound can be improved to \$F {\textbackslash}geq n\_B F\_0\$. In addition, we provide accurate approximations to \$F\$ valid for general {CFTs} in the case of elliptic regions for arbitrary values of the eccentricity which we check against lattice calculations for free fields. We also evaluate \$F\$ numerically for more general shapes in the so-called "Extensive Mutual Information model", verifying the general bound.},

While for circular and elliptic cones this term reproduces the general-{CFT} result, it vanishes for polyhedral corners. For those, we argue that the universal contribution, which is logarithmic, is not controlled by a local integral, but rather it depends on details of the {CFT} in a complicated way. We also study the angle dependence for the entanglement entropy of wedge singularities in 3+1 dimensions. This is done for general {CFTs} in the smooth limit, and using free and holographic {CFTs} at generic angles. In the latter case, we show that the wedge contribution is not proportional to the entanglement entropy of a corner region in the \$(2+1)\$-dimensional holographic {CFT}. Finally, we show that the mutual information of two regions that touch at a point is not necessarily divergent, as long as the contact is through a sufficiently sharp corner. Similarly, we provide examples of singular entangling regions which do not modify the structure of divergences of the entanglement entropy compared with smooth surfaces.},

	abstract = {The holographic entanglement entropy functional for higher-curvature gravities involves a weighted sum whose evaluation, beyond quadratic order, requires a complicated theory-dependent splitting of the Riemann tensor components. Using the splittings of general relativity one can obtain unambiguous formulas perturbatively valid for general higher-curvature gravities. Within this setup, we perform a novel rewriting of the functional which gets rid of the weighted sum. The formula is particularly neat for general cubic and quartic theories, and we use it to explicitly evaluate the corresponding functionals. In the case of Lovelock theories, we find that the anomaly term can be written in terms of the exponential of a differential operator. We also show that order-n densities involving {nR} Riemann tensors (combined with n − {nR} Ricci’s) give rise to terms with up to 2nR − 2 extrinsic curvatures. In particular, densities built from arbitrary Ricci curvatures combined with zero or one Riemann tensors have no anomaly term in their functionals. Finally, we apply our results for cubic gravities to the evaluation of universal terms coming from various symmetric regions in general dimensions. In particular, we show that the universal function characteristic of corner regions in d = 3 gets modified in its functional dependence on the opening angle with respect to the Einstein gravity result.},

	abstract = {We consider a general, classical theory of gravity with arbitrary matter fields in n dimensions, arising from a diffeomorphism-invariant Lagrangian L. We first show that L alwasy can be written in a ‘‘manifestly covariant’’ form. We then show that the symplectic potential current (n-1)-form {FTHETA} and the symplectic current (n-1)-form ω for the theory always can be globally defined in a covariant manner. Associated with any infinitesimal diffeomorphism is a Noether current (n-1)-form J and corresponding Noether charge (n-2)-form Q. We derive a general ‘‘decomposition formula’’ for Q. Using this formula for the Noether charge, we prove that the first law of black hole mechanics holds for arbitrary perturbations of a stationary black hole. (For higher derivative theories, previous arguments had established this law only for stationary perturbations.) Finally, we propose a local, geometrical prescription for the entropy Sdyn of a dynamical black hole. This prescription agrees with the Noether charge formula for stationary black holes and their perturbations, and is independent of all ambiguities associated with the choices of L, {FTHETA}, and Q. However, the issue of whether this dynamical entropy in general obeys a ‘‘second law’’ of black hole mechanics remains open. In an appendix, we apply some of our results to theories with a nondynamical metric and also briefly develop the theory of stress-energy pseudotensors.},

Our formula consists of Wald’s formula for the black hole entropy, as well as corrections involving the extrinsic curvature. We derive these corrections by noting that they arise from naively higher order contributions to the action which are enhanced due to would-be logarithmic divergences. Our formula reproduces the Jacobson-Myers entropy in the context of Lovelock gravity, and agrees with existing results for general four-derivative gravity.},
